This project is the GUI developed for the monitoring, data acquisition and manipulation of PANDORA's team robotic vehicle, under the aegis of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. This work is part of the teamâ€™s project towards its participation in the Robocup-RoboRescue Competitions, from 2011 onwards. 

The GUI was designed and implemented using the Qt framework and integrated with the Robot Operating System (ros.org). 
The repository for the entire project of the PANDORA team is at the following location: https://github.com/pandora-auth-ros-pkg/pandora-auth-ros-pkg
